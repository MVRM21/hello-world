# hello-world
a toast to this time-honored tradition and a  huge welcome to me into the computing world

I'm Mark, I've been a pro musician for over 2 decades but have always been, and I guess always be a gamer at heart. My fascination for the gaming world has recently led me into the 3D world or I guess, the proper term is CG... which led me to Houdini -- in my opinion, the most fascinating and challenging software I have encountered and I just love it! This is the reason why I am here and determined to push myself to the limits in learning to code, use that code for CG and my local network management, automation, and hopefully I get to evolve into machine learning which I find equally fascinating. Kudos to all the peeps in the computing world!!!
